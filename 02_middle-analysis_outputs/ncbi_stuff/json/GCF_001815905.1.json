Information about the Pipeline can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/\nThe WUSC is a large strain collection isolated from clinical samples. Each sample is associated with metadata, including source, isolation site, 16s rRNA, metabolic, and other phenotypic information. The goal is to sample an adequate number of important, yet minor species, further adding to the catelogue of sequenced bacterial genomes and improving the diversity of the genomes available to the public. WGS will be preformed on approximely 550 isolates. Samples were selected based on RDP analysis at the genus level. This project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC.\nCoding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer3 v3.02. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer3 were blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and Rfam v8.1. The final gene set is processed through several programs such as Kegg (Release 56), psortB (Version 3.0.3) and Interproscan (Version 4.7) to determine possible function. Gene product names are determined by BER (Version 2.5). Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs."},"assembly_stats":{"total_sequence_length":"2465058","total_ungapped_length":"2464010","number_of_contigs":80,"contig_n50":83557,"contig_l50":10,"number_of_scaffolds":63,"scaffold_n50":115927,"scaffold_l50":8,"number_of_component_sequences":80,"gc_count":"1538973","gc_percent":62.5,"genome_coverage":"145.0x"},"annotation_info":{"name":"GCF_001815905.1-RS_2024_08_21","provider":"NCBI RefSeq","release_date":"2024-08-21","stats":{"gene_counts":{"total":2289,"protein_coding":2209,"non_coding":50,"pseudogene":30}},"method":"Best-placed reference protein set; GeneMarkS-2+","pipeline":"NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP)","software_version":"6.8"},"wgs_info":{"wgs_project_accession":"LWPT01","master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LWPT00000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/LWPT01"},"checkm_info":{"checkm_marker_set":"Brevibacterium","checkm_species_tax_id":1581130,"checkm_marker_set_rank":"genus","checkm_version":"v1.2.3","completeness":86.1,"contamination":4.18,"completeness_percentile":100},"average_nucleotide_identity":{"taxonomy_check_status":"OK","match_status":"genus_match","submitted_organism":"Brevibacterium sp.
