The sampling point was located near the estuary (36.87981N, 6.93111E) characterized by alkaline water and receiving industrial releases from a petrochemical refinery. The genome was assembled from MiSeq 2x250bp paired-end reads and ONT long reads."},"owner":{"name":"EBI"},"models":["Generic"],"package":"Generic.1.0","attributes":[{"name":"ENA-CHECKLIST","value":"ERC000011"},{"name":"ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC","value":"2020-08-28T17:06:37Z"},{"name":"ENA-LAST-UPDATE","value":"2020-08-26T09:06:46Z"},{"name":"External Id","value":"SAMEA7233140"},{"name":"INSDC center name","value":"GMGM"},{"name":"INSDC first public","value":"2020-08-28T17:06:37Z"},{"name":"INSDC last update","value":"2020-08-26T09:06:46Z"},{"name":"INSDC status","value":"public"},{"name":"Submitter Id","value":"Microbacterium sp.
