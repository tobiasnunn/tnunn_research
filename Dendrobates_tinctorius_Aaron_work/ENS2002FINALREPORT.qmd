# An analysis on the functional relationships inside the skin microbiome of *Dendrobates tinctorius*

## Introduction

\[background stuff, do some reading\] "microbiomes are important because... (ref)" / "they have found to have many effects on their hosts, such as ... (ref)" / "Chitridiomycosis is caused by Bd fungus, this is bad because...(ref)" \[just some ideas\]

\[intro stuff, again, read\] - "*Dendrobates tinctorius* is a model species for this analysis because it is vulnerable to chitridiomycosis, and ... (ref)"/ "microbiomes have been found to relate to disease resistance(ref)"/ "an understanding of the functions and relationships at a genomic level is useful because... (ref)"

## Methods

Many computational programs were employed for this analysis. Free, online samples, taken from the NCBI website's database, were used BECAUSE...

This includes: slurm, bash, R, BLAST, eggNOG-mapper, GTDB-TK, CheckM/CheckM2, etc to produce computational analysis of the genetic makup and relationships between 10 genera sampled by Scientists in the ECW labs at Bangor, and how they relate to online samples...

\[**WWWWWH**/As mentioned above, I used \_\_\_\_package, in \_\_\_, to produce \_\_\_ because \_\_\_. I did this by \_\_\_, \_\_\_ files were created and can be viewed in the GitHub repo. Data was downloaded/ sites were accessed on \_\_\_\]

## Results

\[ok, what is significant enough to go here, the heatmaps, the trees, the CheckM stuff... is that really all i've done this year? i mean, i can include the BLAST stuff for the fly work i did\]

## Conclusions

\[too early to really say anything other than "the samples are what we think they are", still need to do heatmap and tree analysis\]

\[In Conclusion, \_\_\]

\[my next steps will be:

-   doing the second heatmap of the inter-family stuff

-   sourcing other points of interest

-   waiting for Alberto to do more samples for me

-   \]
