## Old stuff

#### old abs

Using public, online data held in databases such as the NCBI website, I will use R and other computational and statistical resources to analyse the genetic makeup of bacterial MAG created genomes, found on the skin microbiome of sampled dyeing poison dart frogs, *Dendrobates tinctorius.* These samples were cultures grown in the labs at ECW in Bangor by Masters and phD researchers. I will combine both home and online datasets to create relevant comparisons, emphasising important genes. Some significant genes have already been found, it will be my first aim to discuss these as relevant to their functions between bacteria in the microbiome, and how they might relate to the host. More methods will be discovered through reading literature in the field. At the end of this course I aim to use my bioinformatics skills to make many visualisations and tables to present novel findings.

# An analysis on the functional relationships inside the skin microbiome of *Dendrobates tinctorius*

### supervisor: Aaron comeault

### Hypothesis:

Making novel genetic comparisons between bacterial genera, with emphasis on differences arising from environment or host, through links betweenits enironment, its evolutionary history and the functions of the proteins coded for.

(very wordy, but its all there, could prob do with cutting down but i dont know what to cut without messing up the whole thing)

possible cutdown: Using an understanding of bacterial ecology and evolution to draw novel \[conclusions/comparisons\] about differences in the genomic function of bacterial genera

## Abstract

Bacterial genomics is a modern field with a storied history. Much research has been done in the field in recent years, however very little taps into the wealth of free genomic data held on websites like the NCBI database. On sites like these there are millions of public bacterial genomes that can be used to better understand the genetic differences and genomic makeup. This information, combined with metadata about the environment or host, can generate novel comparisons about the functional relationships between bacteria and how their evolutionary histories have developed. There are many computer-based tools that can assist with this, including environments like R, the hawk supercomputer and SQL servers. There are many R packages and other online tools that can assist with this, many come with the caveat that they do not handle large workloads well. Using all of these, novel visualisations can be made to present these findings.

## Introduction

Bacterial genomics is a very interesting field, it has evolved a lot over the 30 years the field has existed. The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of *H. influenzae* in 1995 using shotgun sequencing [@fleischmann1995]. Since then there have been many improvements, allowing a huge breadth of Bacterial Phyla to be discovered and better understood. The knowledge gained through understanding the functional components of bacterial genomes can have implications for many fields, such as: bioforensics; disease treatment; biosurveillance and metabolic modeling [@land2015]. There have been 3 generations of technology, with developments being made into the next every year. This has brought even more improvements, for example through sequencing methods like Oxford Nanopore [@abdi2024]. Many studies have utilised these methods, however few discuss microbe genomics in the context of relationships and interactions between microbiomes and their environment or host, and the factors that effect these relationships, one such paper discussed how the microbiome around a species of potato plant (*Solanum tuberosum*), in many fields including crop yield, how these relationships would evolve in a changeing climate was also discussed. This is a good example of why these analyses are important, potatoes are a very important food globally and ensuring food stability is vital for future development [@petrushin2024].

The human gut microbiome has been studied frequently, probably due to the relationship between it and public health, for example diseased like Crohn's disease. One relevant study found that there was a relationship between microbiome size and variation. This analysis phenotyped the samples through barcoding the 16s rRNA gene. Discuss the interaction between host and microbiome[@vandeputte2017]. Another study presented that there can be a huge variation and diversity of skin microbiome of a single host in amphibians. It was also found that members of the same species showed similar microbiomes, whereas there were fewer similarities between different individuals from the same pond [@mckenzie2012]. This presents that any member of the same species, regardless of sampling location, can be used as a model for the species and that these microbiomes have spent millenia adapting to their hosts, which will have no doubt caused complex relationships to develop. ("i can discover the host and run analysis to prove this", feels methods-y, but connects to this) Another previous study found that the skin microbiome is an important factor in disease survival. There are other important elements to the skin of amphibians, for example respiration, that the present microbiome will effect, making a more whole picture of the relationships and functions therein vital [@harris2009]. The practical uses of bacteria in the context of sustainability are varied. A recent study outlined how bacteria are being used to recycle waste gases or biomass and produce products like ethanol, other researchers have found bacteria that break down certain plastics[@rappuoli2025].

Relationships between bacteria have been studied previously, in the context of cooperation in biofilm formation. Both antagonism and cooperation were found in the bacterial species studied. The sample was taken from drinking water, six species were identified and 96 agar plates with different combinations of these were created. Previous studies had found that cooperation lead to more stable communities and a few specific beneficial relationships were identified, for example, plasmid conjugation [@simões2007]. A recent study by [@lunjani2021] discussed host-microbe interactions in human skin with relevance to how modern factors are changing these relationships and causing inflammatory skin diseases. The study outlines how this knowledge could help in creating personalised probiotic solutions to this problem. There are many ways in which bacteria in a microbiome can interact, as mentioned previously, they can cooperate and produce biofilms and share nutrients, however, there also exists competition wherever there is a niche to exploit and limited resources. These relationships cause selection for genes that cause, for example, the production of antimicrobial compounds to inhibit the competitors.

There are many species of bacteria, as such there are almost limitless ways in which they interact with each other in different conditions, gaining better insight into some of the ways in which these relationships occur on a genetic level could have impacts for fields as broad as public health to pollution to zoonotic disease and conservation. This study will aim to investigate some of these relationships in a number of ways using publically available data, and present these in the context of how they might have a beneficial impact on potential host organisms. This work may be cause for future research to be done in the area.

(This study aims to create novel understandings about intra and interspecific relationships inside microbiomes and between microbiomes and their hosts, using genomics as the tool to do this through relating the proteins produced to their potential function in the environment it exists in)

(the plan says "Finish the introduction by stating your objective", i want to make this not the "hypothesis" section above, but if i expand on it it feels too methods-y).

(ok, going good, north of 550)

\[somewhere i feel like a "Amphibian skin microbiome has been disproportionattelly not researched", would be good\]

## Methods

(data will be supplemented by bangor samples on Amphibians as this is an underepresented group)

All analysis will be undertaken computationally by me using data either collected from online repositories, such as the NCBI database, or given to me by the researchers at the ECW labs in Bangor as a by-product of their research. This will involve the use of many R packages and tools on the Hawk supercomputer, operated by SCW, for example the modules `dtdb-tk/2.1.1` and `eggnog-mapper/2.1.12`. This will require me to develop my skills with command-line code as well as slurm and bash scripting. There are many tools in R packages that facilitate high-quality bioinformatics, making use of these is critical for data manipulation and clear data presentation [@sepulveda2020].

As mentioned, this project relates to a larger work conducted by Bangor Masters and Phd researchers, as such, I will be receiving the genomes of up to 100 more bacteria sampled in Bangor labs, with the associated metadata. I will then add these to my existing data-pool and rerun past research in light of this data-influx. This includes; CheckM analysis, GTDBTK analysis and eggNOG-mapper analysis. This will update the phylogenetic trees and heatmaps that already exist, and allow for a database of these samples to be made, into which I can put the associated metadata.

Part of my work will be to discover and use more advanced computational applications. For example, the use of PostgreSQL for data storage, as opposed to the file system on my machine. This is to develop my skills as a bioinformatician, especially in reference to creating novel diagrams in R.

For example, a specific genera of interest, identified in 1 sample of the 10 local samples is the genus *Pantoea*. This is an interesting genus with a large variety of functions and relationships. Isolates from this genus have been found to have functions ranging from herbicide degridation to nitrogen fixation to antibiotic production. Samples have been found in hospitals, suggesting a possible link to disease in some capacity, this could make this genera interesting from a Chytridiomycosis point of view. An understanding of this genus could be beneficial for future research in the area [@walterson2015]. Another genera of interest is Sphingomonas, samples have been found to be beneficial to host plant health, with little known about the genomics and internal mechanisms of how they produce these benefits [@asaf2020].

The discovery of novel avenues of discovery will be important to this project. Requiring me to study the literature surrounding bacterial genomics thoroughly to find more methods. For example, the chemical violacein is important in chytridiomycosis defence [@becker2009], thus, I can look to identify it in the online samples, in order to create a distribution or possible evolutionary history of the gene that codes for this chemical.

There is a wealth of data surrounding the public samples, for example, location data can feed the creation of maps that identify the source location of the samples, and figures can be created surrounding the host they were sampled from, these fields can then also feed secondary analysis, such as how samples from e.g. Europe and Africa differ.

Further public analysis will include intra-specific comparisons of genera inside families where more than 1 Bangor sample has been identified, i.e. *Sphingomonas* and *Microbacterium*, these will help illuminate how the genera inside these families differ from each other. This will be a simple, if time consuming, process, as the analysis pipeline has already been created, the new public samples just need to be processed.

The data is downloaded directly off of the NCBI and KEGG websites, this then feeds into a data-analysis pipeline that processes the raw genomes in .fasta format through eggNOG-mapper, these are then run through the `enrichKO` package in R to find the KEGG map-ids, which, after further processing in R, can then be turned into heatmaps to identify important pathways in these groups, grouping by the genera. This is taken to mean any pathway where there is more than 80% enrichment in one group and less than 50% in the others. The use of the R package `GTDB-TK` can also be used to create phylogenetic trees in R. Metadata is also downloaded off of both sites to help with clarity in the visuals, as well as providing further avenues of study. Once the important genes are identified, then the implications of those pathways in reference to the bacterial community and host can be illuminated.

Poison dart frogs were chosen for this because other research was already being conducted on them by Bangor researchers, so the sequenced bacterial MAGs were available for me to conduct secondary analysis on. They are also convenient due to the importance of microbiomes to life, the skin of amphibians is especially important, due to its use as a site for respiration, thus the microbiome therein should have important interactions with the host. This research could have implications for developing methods for combating chytridiomycosis infection in these animals. For example, the relationship between microbiome and fungal infection is not simple, and past research into probiotic solutions has had issues, so a greater understanding could help develop novel solutions or reveal more about existing processes [@mcknight2022].

This study shares methods with a previous analysis involving *E coli*, which similarly used the wealth of publically available samples to do analysis with bioinformatics [@edwards2013]. An understanding of their relationships with their skin microbiomes, and the interspecific functions, variation and competition therein, through funcitonal genomics might give us a better idea of how these often cryptic animals fit into their niches in their environment. This could help us develop plans to protect them from dangers such as chytridiomycosis through a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play, as well as a potential host of novel information generated surrounding these mysterious microbiomes and possibly inspiring more scientists to follow on from this study. This will include analyses using public data, a lesser-used methodology in the area, this has the benefit that analysis can be done faster than with traditional methods, as the repositories contain years worth of data that is almost immediately accessible. This project could have real-world impacts on the future study of microbiome genomics.
