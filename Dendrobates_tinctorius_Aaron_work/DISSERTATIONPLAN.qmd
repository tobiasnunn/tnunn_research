OUTLINE FOR DISSERTATION PLANS:\
Name:\
Title of the project:\
Name of the Supervisor: So we know who to send the plan to for grading!\
Hypothesis/ Aim: clearly state what you want to test.\
Abstract/ Summary: max 150 words (remember your abstract in the essay last semester). This is different\
from the lay summary. Include a problem statement, your intended approach, your outcomes (potential\
findings of your study or the outcomes of discussions with your supervisor over the approach you will take)\
and the implications of your study.\
\*Introduction/ Background: What has been published so far? Why is it important to test this hypothesis/do\
this work? Finish the introduction by stating your objective. For some more exploratory projects that use\
published literature as the source material & the data, specific objectives might be difficult to define at this\
stage. Speak to your supervisor if you are unsure. 750 words.\
†Materials and Methods: What kind of equipment will you use? What are the reagents? What methods/\
experimental design will you exploit? How will you collect your data? What software? Which statistical\
analyses? 750 words.\
Figures and flowcharts fit in nicely into Materials and Methods. Figure titles & legends do not count towards\
the word limit. Students undertaking literature-based meta-analyses might present some preliminary data.\
Methodologies vary between different subjects and different groups; get your supervisor’s help for this part.\
References (obviously).\
†Commitment (optional; 100 words): Reflect on why you chose this project, what you expect from the project\
and how you would define the success or failure of the project.\
Risk Assessment form; Ethics Checklist: A key part of assessing the viability of a project is assessing the\
hazards & risks involved. You will be carrying out the project, you need to understand these risks. Similarly,\
as researchers, we have a responsibility to the animals and people we work with. Because of this, failure to\
include either form may result in being awarded 0%. These forms do not contribute to the word count but\
starting the research without approved RA or ethics clearance is breaking the law and is a disciplinary offence\
under the university regulations.

# An analysis on the functional relationships inside the skin microbiome of *Dendrobates tinctorius*

### supervisor: Aaron comeault

Hypothesis: There are genetic, functional relationships both between bacteria inside the skin microbiome of poison dart frogs, *Dendrobates tinctorius,* and there are host-microbe interactions.

## Abstract

Using public, online data held in databases such as the NCBI website, I will use R and other computational and statistical resources to analyse the genetic makeup of becterial cells found in the skin microbiome of individuals of the dyeing poison dart frog, *Dendrobates tinctorius.* This online comparison is aided by bacterial cultures grown in the labs at ECW in Bangor by Masters and phD researchers. Significant genes have already been found, it will be my first aim to understand what the functions of these genes are in connection to the microbiome as a whole and present them. A large part of this dissertation will be reading associated literature in the field to identify methods I wish to use myself. At the end of this course I aim to be able to show a greater understanding of this emerging field and have many visualisations and tables to present new findings.

## Introduction

This project builds on work done by [@harris2009].This is a study very relevant to the current one, testing was conducted on another Anuran species. It was found that the skin microbiome is an important factor in disease survival. There are other important elements to the skin of amphibians, for example respiration, that the present microbiome will effect, making a more whole picture of the relationships and functions therein vital.

Poison dart frogs were chosen for this because they are a model amphibian (\_\_\_)

This could have implications for defending against chytridiomycosis infection.

I aim to discover new relationships inside microbiota and between host and microbiome. A greater understanding of the genetics involved could yield results in combating infection through probiotic suplementation of the skin microbiome.

## Methods

All analysis will be undertaken computationally by me using data either harvested from online repositories, or given to me by the researchers at the ECW labs. A specific analysis I will run early on is to bring down all the samples generated by GTDB-TK for the families (Sphingomonadacea and Microbacteriacea) and compare the genera within them for highly expressed genes. This will involve ..., this is important because...

This project will result in a better understanding of interactions between microbiota, with possible implications for defence against chytridiomycosis...
