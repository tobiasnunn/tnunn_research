	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases are a serious threat to wildlife populations, and there is growing evidence that host microbiomes play important roles in infection dynamics, possibly even mitigating diseases. Nevertheless, most research on this topic has focused only on bacterial microbiomes, while fungal microbiomes have been largely neglected. To help fill this gap in our knowledge, we examined both the bacterial and fungal microbiomes of four sympatric Australian frog species, which had different population-level responses to the emergence of chytridiomycosis, a widespread disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We sequenced 16,884 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and 41,774 bacterial ASVs. Bacterial communities had higher richness and were less variable within frog species than were fungal communities. Nevertheless, both communities were correlated for both ASV richness and beta diversity (i.e., frogs with similar bacterial richness and community composition tended to also have similar fungal richness and community composition). This suggests that either one microbial community was having a large impact on the other or that they were both being driven by similar environmental factors. For both microbial taxa, we found little evidence of associations between Bd (prevalence or intensity) and either individuals’ ASVs or beta diversity. However, there was mixed evidence of associations between richness (both bacterial and fungal) and Bd, with high richness potentially providing a protective effect. Surprisingly, the relative abundance of bacteria that have previously been shown to inhibit Bd was also positively associated with Bd infection intensity, suggesting that a high relative abundance of those bacteria provides poor protection against infection.},

	abstract = {Shifts in microbiome community composition can have large effects on host health. It is therefore important to understand how perturbations, like those caused by the introduction of exogenous chemicals, modulate microbiome community composition. In poison frogs within the family Dendrobatidae, the skin microbiome is exposed to the alkaloids that the frogs sequester from their diet and use for defense. Given the demonstrated antimicrobial effects of these poison frog alkaloids, these compounds may be structuring the skin microbial community. To test this, we first characterized microbial communities from chemically defended and closely related non-defended frogs from Ecuador. Then we conducted a laboratory experiment to monitor the effect of the alkaloid decahydroquinoline (DHQ) on the microbiome of a single frog species. In both the field and lab experiments, we found that alkaloid-exposed microbiomes are more species rich and phylogenetically diverse, with an increase in rare taxa. To better understand the strain-specific behavior in response to alkaloids, we cultured microbial strains from poison frog skin and found the majority of strains exhibited either enhanced growth or were not impacted by the addition of DHQ. Additionally, stable isotope tracing coupled to nanoSIMS suggests that some of these strains are able to metabolize DHQ. Taken together, these data suggest that poison frog chemical defenses open new niches for skin-associated microbes with specific adaptations, including the likely metabolism of alkaloids, that enable their survival in this toxic environment. This work helps expand our understanding of how exposure to exogenous compounds like alkaloids can impact host microbiomes.},

	abstract = {Background: The fungal pathogenBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) threatens amphibian biodiversity and ecosystem stability worldwide. Amphibian skin microbial community structure has been linked to the clinical outcome of Bd infections, yet its overall functional importance is poorly understood.
Methods: Microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles were assessed using high-throughput bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 gene sequencing, bacterial shotgun metagenomics and skin mucosal metabolomics. We sampled 56 wild midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans) from montane populations exhibiting Bd epizootic or enzootic disease dynamics. In addition, to assess whether disease-specific microbiome profiles were linked to microbe-mediated protection or Bd-induced perturbation, we performed a laboratory Bd challenge experiment whereby 40 young adult A. obstetricans were exposed to Bd or a control sham infection. We measured temporal changes in the microbiome as well as functional profiles of Bd-exposed and control animals at peak infection.
Results: Microbiome community structure and function differed in wild populations based on infection history and in experimental control versus Bd-exposed animals. Bd exposure in the laboratory resulted in dynamic changes in microbiome community structure and functional differences, with infection clearance in all but one infected animal. Sphingobacterium, Stenotrophomonas and an unclassified Commamonadaceae were associated with wild epizootic dynamics and also had reduced abundance in laboratory Bd-exposed animals that cleared infection, indicating a negative association with Bd resistance. This was further supported by microbe-metabolite integration which identified functionally relevant taxa driving disease outcome, of which Sphingobacterium and Bd were most influential in wild epizootic dynamics. The strong correlation between microbial taxonomic community composition and skin metabolome in the laboratory and field is inconsistent with microbial functional redundancy, indicating that differences in microbial taxonomy drive functional variation. Shotgun metagenomic analyses support these findings, with similar disease-associated patterns in beta diversity. Analysis of differentially abundant bacterial genes and pathways indicated that bacterial environmental sensing and Bd resource competition are likely to be important in driving infection outcomes.
Conclusions: Bd infection drives altered microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles across laboratory and field environments. Our application of multi-omics analyses in experimental and field settings robustly predicts Bd disease dynamics and identifies novel candidate biomarkers of infection.},

            Host-associated microbial communities can mediate interactions between their hosts and biotic and abiotic environments. While much work has been done to document how microbiomes vary across species and environments, much less is known about the functional consequences of this variation. Here, we test for functional variation among drosophilid-associated bacteria by conducting Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing and generating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from six species of drosophilid fly collected in association with ‘anthropogenic’ environments in North America, Europe, and Africa. Using phylogenetic analyses, we find that drosophilid flies harbor a diverse microbiome that includes core members closely related to the genera

            Orbus

            Dysgonomonas
            , and others. Comparisons with publicly available bacterial genomes show that many of these genera are associated with phylogenetically diverse insect gut microbiomes. Using functional annotations and predicted secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, we show that MAGs belonging to different bacterial orders and genera vary in gene content and predicted functions including metabolic capacity and how they respond to environmental stressors. Our results provide evidence that wild drosophilid flies harbor phylogenetically and functionally diverse microbial communities. These findings highlight a need to quantify the abundance and function of insect-associated bacteria from the genera

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity may pave the way for rapid adaptation to newly encountered environments. Although it is often contested, there is growing evidence that initial plastic responses of ancestral populations to new environmental cues may promote subsequent adaptation. However, we do not know whether plasticity to cues present in the ancestral habitat (past-cue plasticity) can facilitate adaptation to novel cues. Conceivably, this could occur if plastic responses are coincidentally optimal to both past and novel cues (i.e., are preadaptive) or if they are transferred to novel cues during adaptation. Past plastic phenotype values could also become fixed during adaptation to the new environment. To uncover the role of past-cue plasticity in adaptation, we tested gene expression plasticity responses of two parallel mine-waste-adapted
              Silene uniflora
              populations and their closest coastal relatives. Plants were exposed to the past and novel cues of salt and zinc, which revealed that during adaptation to mine waste, plasticity to salt diminishes. Despite this, our results show that ancestral plasticity to salt has a substantial impact on subsequent adaptation to zinc. For a third of genes that have evolved zinc plasticity in mine populations, salt plasticity has been transferred to the zinc response. Furthermore, a quarter of fixed expression differences between mine and coastal populations were similar to ancestral salt responses. Alongside evidence that ancestral plasticity to novel cues can facilitate adaptation, our results provide a clear indication that ancestral past-cue plasticity can also play a key role in rapid, parallel adaptation to novel habitats.},

	abstract = {Genome size varies greatly across the tree of life and transposable elements are an important contributor to this variation. Among vertebrates, amphibians display the greatest variation in genome size, making them ideal models to explore the causes and consequences of genome size variation. However, high-quality genome assemblies for amphibians have, until recently, been rare. Here, we generate a high-quality genome assembly for the dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We compare this assembly to publicly available frog genomes and find evidence for both large-scale conserved synteny and widespread rearrangements between frog lineages. Comparing conserved orthologs annotated in these genomes revealed a strong correlation between genome size and gene size. To explore the cause of gene-size variation, we quantified the location of transposable elements relative to gene features and find that the accumulation of transposable elements in introns has played an important role in the evolution of gene size in D. tinctorius, while estimates of insertion times suggest that many insertion events are recent and species-specific. Finally, we carry out population-scale mobile-element sequencing and show that the diversity and abundance of transposable elements in poison frog genomes can complicate genotyping from repetitive element sequence anchors. Our results show that transposable elements have clearly played an important role in the evolution of large genome size in D. tinctorius. Future studies are needed to fully understand the dynamics of transposable element evolution and to optimize primer or bait design for cost-effective population-level genotyping in species with large, repetitive genomes.},

	abstract = {Gut bacteria can affect key aspects of host fitness, such as development, fecundity, and lifespan, while the host, in turn, shapes the gut microbiome. However, it is unclear to what extent individual species versus community interactions within the microbiome are linked to host fitness. Here, we combinatorially dissect the natural microbiome of
              Drosophila melanogaster
              and reveal that interactions between bacteria shape host fitness through life history tradeoffs. Empirically, we made germ-free flies colonized with each possible combination of the five core species of fly gut bacteria. We measured the resulting bacterial community abundances and fly fitness traits, including development, reproduction, and lifespan. The fly gut promoted bacterial diversity, which, in turn, accelerated development, reproduction, and aging: Flies that reproduced more died sooner. From these measurements, we calculated the impact of bacterial interactions on fly fitness by adapting the mathematics of genetic epistasis to the microbiome. Development and fecundity converged with higher diversity, suggesting minimal dependence on interactions. However, host lifespan and microbiome abundances were highly dependent on interactions between bacterial species. Higher-order interactions (involving three, four, and five species) occurred in 13–44\% of possible cases depending on the trait, with the same interactions affecting multiple traits, a reflection of the life history tradeoff. Overall, we found these interactions were frequently context-dependent and often had the same magnitude as individual species themselves, indicating that the interactions can be as important as the individual species in gut microbiomes.},

In this review, we highlight some of the recent ﬁndings on the mechanisms through which microbes interact with each other on the skin and the signalling systems that mediate communication between the immune system and skin-associated microbes. In addition, we summarize the ongoing clinical studies that are targeting the microbiome in patients with skin disorders.

Altered ecological interactions between mutualistic microbes and hosts can result in disease, but an understanding of interactions between host, microbes and disease-causing organisms may lead to management strategies to affect disease outcomes. Many amphibian species in relatively pristine habitats are experiencing dramatic population declines and extinctions due to the skin disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Using a randomized, replicated experiment, we show that adding an antifungal bacterial species, Janthinobacterium lividum, found on several species of amphibians to the skins of the frog Rana muscosa prevented morbidity and mortality caused by the pathogen. The bacterial species produces the anti-chytrid metabolite violacein, which was found in much higher concentrations on frog skins in the treatments where J. lividum was added. Our results show that cutaneous microbes are a part of amphibians' innate immune system, the microbial community structure on frog skins is a determinant of disease outcome and altering microbial interactions on frog skins can prevent a lethal disease outcome. A bioaugmentation strategy may be an effective management tool to control chytridiomycosis in amphibian survival assurance colonies and in nature.},

	abstract = {Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold. How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics, and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future, high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

This introduction offers a synopsis of NGS and its profound implications across diverse areas of biological research and medical diagnostics. The fundamental principles underlying NGS, including library preparation, sequencing-by-synthesis, and data generation, are outlined. The different NGS platforms, such as Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Oxford Nanopore, as well as their respective strengths and limitations, are discussed. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, long-read sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, are explored, expanding the capabilities of NGS and facilitating comprehensive genomic investigations. Subsequently, the applications of NGS in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, and personalized medicine are examined. The accelerated discovery of genetic variants, gene expression patterns, DNA methylation profiles, and microbial communities through NGS is emphasized. Moreover, the role of NGS in uncovering disease mechanisms, identifying therapeutic targets, and enabling precision medicine approaches is discussed. Furthermore, the computational challenges associated with NGS data analysis, including read alignment, variant calling, and data interpretation, are addressed. The pivotal role of bioinformatics and data analysis pipelines in transforming raw sequencing data into biologically meaningful insights is highlighted. Additionally, the integration of NGS data with other omics datasets and the emerging field of multi-omics integration, providing a holistic view of biological systems, are briefly touched upon.},

	abstract = {The complete sequences of two small bacterial genomes have recently become available, and those of several more species should follow within the next two years. Sequence comparisons show that the most bacterial proteins are highly conserved in evolution, allowing predictions to be made about the functions of most products of an uncharacterized genome. Bacterial genomes differ vastly in their gene repertoires. Although genes for components of the translation and transcription machinery, and for molecular chaperones, are typically maintained, many regulatory and metabolic systems are absent in bacteria with small genomes. Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest known genome of any cellular life form, lacks virtually all known regulatory genes, and its gene expression may be regulated differently than in other bacteria. Genome organization is evolutionarily labile: extensive gene shuffling leaves only very few conserved gene arrays in distantly related bacteria.},

	abstract = {The disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is associated with recent declines in amphibian populations. Susceptibility to this disease varies among amphibian populations and species, and resistance appears to be attributable in part to the presence of antifungal microbial species associated with the skin of amphibians. The betaproteobacterium Janthinobacterium lividum has been isolated from the skins of several amphibian species and produces the antifungal metabolite violacein, which inhibits B. dendrobatidis. In this study, we added J. lividum to red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) to obtain an increased range of violacein concentrations on the skin. Adding J. lividum to the skin of the salamander increased the concentration of violacein on the skin, which was strongly associated with survival after experimental exposure to B. dendrobatidis. As expected from previous work, some individuals that did not receive J. lividum and were exposed to B. dendrobatidis survived. These individuals had concentrations of bacterially produced violacein on their skins that were predicted to kill B. dendrobatidis. Our study suggests that a threshold violacein concentration of about 18 microM on a salamander's skin prevents mortality and morbidity caused by B. dendrobatidis. In addition, we show that over one-half of individuals in nature support antifungal bacteria that produce violacein, which suggests that there is a mutualism between violacein-producing bacteria and P. cinereus and that adding J. lividum is effective for protecting individuals that lack violacein-producing skin bacteria.},

	abstract = {Every land plant exists in a close relationship with microbial communities of several niches: rhizosphere, endosphere, phyllosphere, etc. The growth and yield of potato—a critical food crop worldwide—highly depend on the diversity and structure of the bacterial and fungal communities with which the potato plant coexists. The potato plant has a specific part, tubers, and the soil near the tubers as a sub-compartment is usually called the “geocaulosphere”, which is associated with the storage process and tare soil microbiome. Specific microbes can help the plant to adapt to particular environmental conditions and resist pathogens. There are a number of approaches to modulate the microbiome that provide organisms with desired features during inoculation. The mechanisms of plant–bacterial communication remain understudied, and for further engineering of microbiomes with particular features, the knowledge on the potato microbiome should be summarized. The most recent approaches to microbiome engineering include the construction of a synthetic microbial community or management of the plant microbiome using genome engineering. In this review, the various factors that determine the microbiome of potato and approaches that allow us to mitigate the negative impact of drought and pathogens are surveyed.},

	abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

Similarly, microbiomes of other higher organisms play key roles in disease, health, growth and development of their host. Exploring microbiome functions across kingdoms holds enormous potential to understand common mechanisms and concepts underlying microbiome assembly and microbial processes that sustain life of Eukaryotes. The gut and plant rhizosphere are both open systems with large surface areas overpopulated with microbes. Despite distinct differences in microbiome composition, these two ecosystems share striking similarities in microbiome functions related to nutrient acquisition, immune system modulation and protection against infections. We also discuss how humans and plants exchange microbes, for better or for worse. We propose that adopting ecological theory, combined with modeling and synthetic microbial ecosystems, provides a promising strategy to identify host traits and cues involved in microbiome assembly on and in Eukaryotes.},
