	abstract = {The prevalence and severity of dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis have increased dramatically during recent decades. Many of the factors associated with an altered risk of developing inﬂammatory skin disorders have also been shown to alter the composition and diversity of non-pathogenic microbial communities that inhabit the human host. While the most densely microbial populated organ is the gut, culture and non-culture-based technologies have revealed a dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, viruses and mites that exist on healthy human skin, which change during disease. In this review, we highlight some of the recent ﬁndings on the mechanisms through which microbes interact with each other on the skin and the signalling systems that mediate communication between the immune system and skin-associated microbes. In addition, we summarize the ongoing clinical studies that are targeting the microbiome in patients with skin disorders. While signiﬁcant efforts are still required to decipher the mechanisms underpinning host-microbe communication relevant to skin health, it is likely that disease-related microbial communities, or Dermatypes, will help identify personalized treatments and appropriate microbial reconstitution strategies.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases threaten human and wildlife populations. Altered ecological interactions between mutualistic microbes and hosts can result in disease, but an understanding of interactions between host, microbes and disease-causing organisms may lead to management strategies to affect disease outcomes. Many amphibian species in relatively pristine habitats are experiencing dramatic population declines and extinctions due to the skin disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Using a randomized, replicated experiment, we show that adding an antifungal bacterial species, Janthinobacterium lividum, found on several species of amphibians to the skins of the frog Rana muscosa prevented morbidity and mortality caused by the pathogen. The bacterial species produces the anti-chytrid metabolite violacein, which was found in much higher concentrations on frog skins in the treatments where J. lividum was added. Our results show that cutaneous microbes are a part of amphibians' innate immune system, the microbial community structure on frog skins is a determinant of disease outcome and altering microbial interactions on frog skins can prevent a lethal disease outcome. A bioaugmentation strategy may be an effective management tool to control chytridiomycosis in amphibian survival assurance colonies and in nature.},

	abstract = {Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold. How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics, and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future, high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

This introduction offers a synopsis of NGS and its profound implications across diverse areas of biological research and medical diagnostics. The fundamental principles underlying NGS, including library preparation, sequencing-by-synthesis, and data generation, are outlined. The different NGS platforms, such as Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Oxford Nanopore, as well as their respective strengths and limitations, are discussed. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, long-read sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, are explored, expanding the capabilities of NGS and facilitating comprehensive genomic investigations. Subsequently, the applications of NGS in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, and personalized medicine are examined. The accelerated discovery of genetic variants, gene expression patterns, DNA methylation profiles, and microbial communities through NGS is emphasized. Moreover, the role of NGS in uncovering disease mechanisms, identifying therapeutic targets, and enabling precision medicine approaches is discussed. Furthermore, the computational challenges associated with NGS data analysis, including read alignment, variant calling, and data interpretation, are addressed. The pivotal role of bioinformatics and data analysis pipelines in transforming raw sequencing data into biologically meaningful insights is highlighted. Additionally, the integration of NGS data with other omics datasets and the emerging field of multi-omics integration, providing a holistic view of biological systems, are briefly touched upon.},

	abstract = {Although all plant and animal species harbor microbial symbionts, we know surprisingly little about the specificity of microbial communities to their hosts. Few studies have compared the microbiomes of different species of animals, and fewer still have examined animals in the wild. We sampled four pond habitats in Colorado, USA, where multiple amphibian species were present. In total, 32 amphibian individuals were sampled from three different species including northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens), western chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata) and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum). We compared the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities on the skin of the collected individuals via barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Dominant bacterial phyla included Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. In total, we found members of 18 bacterial phyla, comparable to the taxonomic diversity typically found on human skin. Levels of bacterial diversity varied strongly across species: L. pipiens had the highest diversity; A. tigrinum the lowest. Host species was a highly significant predictor of bacterial community similarity, and co-habitation within the same pond was not significant, highlighting that the skin-associated bacterial communities do not simply reflect those bacterial communities found in their surrounding environments. Innate species differences thus appear to regulate the structure of skin bacterial communities on amphibians. In light of recent discoveries that some bacteria on amphibian skin have antifungal activity, our finding suggests that host-specific bacteria may have a role in the species-specific resistance to fungal pathogens.},

The potato plant has a specific part, tubers, and the soil near the tubers as a sub-compartment is usually called the “geocaulosphere”, which is associated with the storage process and tare soil microbiome. Specific microbes can help the plant to adapt to particular environmental conditions and resist pathogens. There are a number of approaches to modulate the microbiome that provide organisms with desired features during inoculation. The mechanisms of plant–bacterial communication remain understudied, and for further engineering of microbiomes with particular features, the knowledge on the potato microbiome should be summarized. The most recent approaches to microbiome engineering include the construction of a synthetic microbial community or management of the plant microbiome using genome engineering. In this review, the various factors that determine the microbiome of potato and approaches that allow us to mitigate the negative impact of drought and pathogens are surveyed.},

	abstract = {In the environment, multiple microorganisms coexist as communities, competing for resources and often associated as biofilms. In this study, single- and dual-species biofilm formation by, and specific activities of, six heterotrophic intergeneric bacteria were determined using 96-well polystyrene plates over a 72-h period. These bacteria were isolated from drinking water and identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A series of planktonic studies was also performed, assessing the bacterial growth rate, motility, and production of quorum-sensing inhibitors (QSI). This constituted an attempt to identify key attributes allowing bacteria to effectively interact and coexist in a drinking-water environment. We observed that in both pure and dual cultures, all of the isolates formed stable biofilms within 72 h, with specific metabolic activity decreasing, in most cases, with an increase in biofilm mass. The largest single- and dual-biofilm amounts were found for Methylobacterium sp. and the combination of Methylobacterium sp. and Mycobacterium mucogenicum, respectively. Evidences of microbial interactions in dual-biofilm formation, associated with appreciable biomass variation in comparison with single biofilms, were found for the following cases: synergy/cooperation between Sphingomonas capsulata and Burkholderia cepacia, S. capsulata and Staphylococcus sp., and B. cepacia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and antagonism between S. capsulata and M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata and A. calcoaceticus, and M. mucogenicum and Staphylococcus sp. A neutral interaction was found for Methylobacterium sp.-M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata-Staphylococcus sp., M. mucogenicum-A. calcoaceticus, and Methylobacterium sp.-A. calcoaceticus biofilms, since the resultant dual biofilms had a mass and specific metabolic activity similar to the average for each single biofilm. B. cepacia had the highest growth rate and motility and produced QSI. Other bacteria producing QSI were Methylobacterium sp., S. capsulata, and Staphylococcus sp. However, only for S. capsulata-M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata-A. calcoaceticus, and M. mucogenicum-Staphylococcus sp., dual-biofilm formation seems to be regulated by the QSI produced by S. capsulata and Staphylococcus sp. and by the increased growth rate of S. capsulata. The parameters assessed by planktonic studies did not allow prediction and generalization of the exact mechanism regulating dual-species biofilm formation between the drinking-water bacteria.},

The gut and plant rhizosphere are both open systems with large surface areas overpopulated with microbes. Despite distinct differences in microbiome composition, these two ecosystems share striking similarities in microbiome functions related to nutrient acquisition, immune system modulation and protection against infections.

Since amphibians are currently facing population declines and extinctions attributable to anthropogenic pressures and emerging diseases, an understanding of the effects of microbiome dysbiosis and mitigation is a prerequisite for amphibian conservation and disease management. Interest is now growing with regard to understanding the influence of unfavorable environmental conditions on the amphibian microbiome and the effects of dysbiosis on the susceptibility to pathogenic infections. Here, we summarize information on the amphibian microbiome, specifically concerning intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape the skin and gut microbiome. We explore diverse types of unfavorable environmental perturbations and the ways in which they can impact the microbiota of an individual so that we can better comprehend the consequences of stressors and dysbiosis on pathogen emergence and health. We discuss the role of the microbiome in amphibian conservation and identify gaps of knowledge that need to be filled if we are to achieve a meta-organism conservation approach. NGS studies should be complemented with other high-throughput “-omic” approaches to target microbiome functionality. Understanding the microbiome might be the missing piece in the overall strategy that will help maintain the health of amphibians in a world with highly affected environments and that will prevent/mitigate emerging infectious diseases.},
