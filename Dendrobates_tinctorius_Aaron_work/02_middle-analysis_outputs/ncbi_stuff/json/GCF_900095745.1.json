Here, we report the genome of M. oxydans with a size of 3,989,887 bp. DNA sequencing library was prepared using the NEBNext Quick DNA Sample prep. Master Mix 2 (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswitch, MA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The tagged library was sequenced as 250 bp paired end reads using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)."},"owner":{"name":"EBI"},"models":["Generic"],"package":"Generic.1.0","attributes":[{"name":"ENA first public","value":"2016-10-25"},{"name":"ENA last update","value":"2016-08-26"},{"name":"ENA-CHECKLIST","value":"ERC000011"},{"name":"External Id","value":"SAMEA4402499"},{"name":"INSDC center alias","value":"UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY"},{"name":"INSDC center name","value":"UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY"},{"name":"INSDC first public","value":"2016-10-25T17:01:12Z"},{"name":"INSDC last update","value":"2016-08-26T09:11:42Z"},{"name":"INSDC status","value":"public"},{"name":"Submitter Id","value":"Moxy_1"},{"name":"sample_name","value":"Moxy_1"}],"status":{"status":"live","when":"2016-10-27T11:07:43.400"},"sample_name":"Moxy_1"}},"assembly_stats":{"total_sequence_length":"3989887","total_ungapped_length":"3989887","number_of_contigs":21,"contig_n50":446062,"contig_l50":4,"number_of_component_sequences":21,"gc_count":"2737959","gc_percent":68.5,"genome_coverage":"44.0x"},"annotation_info":{"name":"GCF_900095745.1-RS_2024_05_31","provider":"NCBI RefSeq","release_date":"2024-05-31","stats":{"gene_counts":{"total":3841,"protein_coding":3778,"non_coding":55,"pseudogene":8}},"method":"Best-placed reference protein set; GeneMarkS-2+","pipeline":"NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP)","software_version":"6.7"},"wgs_info":{"wgs_project_accession":"FMIR01","master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FMIR00000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/FMIR01"},"checkm_info":{"checkm_marker_set":"Microbacterium","checkm_species_tax_id":82380,"checkm_marker_set_rank":"genus","checkm_version":"v1.2.2","completeness":99.58,"contamination":0.71,"completeness_percentile":92.30769},"average_nucleotide_identity":{"taxonomy_check_status":"Inconclusive","match_status":"below_threshold_mismatch","submitted_organism":"Microbacterium oxydans","submitted_species":"Microbacterium oxydans","category":"category_na","submitted_ani_match":{"assembly":"GCA_006540085.1","organism_name":"Microbacterium oxydans","category":"type","ani":85.67,"assembly_coverage":62.04,"type_assembly_coverage":63.59},"best_ani_match":{"assembly":"GCA_008868125.1","organism_name":"Microbacterium maritypicum","category":"type","ani":86.69,"assembly_coverage":61.73,"type_assembly_coverage":67.14},"comment":"na"}}],"total_count":1}
