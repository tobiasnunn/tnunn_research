# 2024-12-24 de novo prelim
## Introduction

3 days ago i was looking through the gtdbtk manual and saw that `de_novo_wf` was an option for analysis to create the trees, from the description given:

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://ecogenomics.github.io/GTDBTk/commands/de_novo_wf.html")
```

i beleived this would be something i should do as it might produce more accurate trees. sample `1Dt2d` *Enterobacter cancerogenus* had been placed by the `classify_wf` in the previous gtdbtk analysis in the genus *Pantoea*, which lead me to this search. after a bit of trial and error, i produced [this script](https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/blob/21f2fb071d76040dc82286b9399cb11ff11a3b3c/00_scripts/de_novo_gtdbtk.sh)

## Methods

This ran as a slurm job on hawk (SCW) from rougly 20:10 on the 23rd to 01:00 on the 24th, totalling 4 hours and 50 minutes. The main parameters that i experimented with were

~~~
- #SBATCH --ntasks=5
- #SBATCH --time=24:00:00
- #SBATCH --mem=50g
- --cpus 10
~~~

I settled on these as being the "best", however, it is entirely possible that they could be more optimised. 

## Results

This analysis produced these files:

~~~


I then moved this `gtdbtk.bac120.decorated.tree` file into Dendroscope for review, all 10 are on one tree, but `1Dt2d` is still being placed in the "wrong" genus. on review of its [sister accession](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000773965.1/) on the ncbi database.

## Conclusion

On the NCBI page for the sister accession, can be found a **CheckM** analysis that comes back with

> completeness: 90%  
contamination: 3.6%  
Taxonomy check status: failed

Upon viewing the tree in Dendroscope, the joining node has the label `0.968`. This I believe to be the probability the relationship is correct. this implies they are the same species, and the online sample is also identified as *Enterobacter cancerogenus*. However, due to the checkm analysis i find it plausible that they both have been misidentified and are in reality Pantoea species, i find this the most parsimonious explanation. I will follow this up with a CheckM analysis of my own on `1Dt2d`

This was a "technical spike" or proof of concept for `de_novo_wf`

# 2024-12-25 &#127876; begginning of table, checkm
## introduction
i wanted to see if the outputs of checkm differed from checkm2 so ran that on hawk. I also began recreating the innital table for metadata about the bangor samples, in the spirit of automation, a less manual approach was chosen this time around.

## methods
using [this script](https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/blob/6be0be8a1de6b7fd64de79c280d9641f68a0e37c/00_scripts/checkmtest.sh) i ran a slurm job on hawk under the `lineage_wf` of CheckM for all 10 Bangor-made samples, this took just 4 minutes. I also worked on exporting the data i want to tabulate off of hawk. The **past** way i did this was by manually entering each file and noting down the important characteristics. However, because there are going to be more samples(and i wanted to be clever) i decided to use a more automated process. This was done by identifying different documents in the flye directories on hawk, specifically files called "assembly_info.txt" which contain the same information, but are vastly more exportable. These are stored here:
cd /scratch/scw2160/02_outputs/flye_asm/flye_asm_[accession]/
using [this script](https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/blob/6be0be8a1de6b7fd64de79c280d9641f68a0e37c/00_scripts/assemblytabledatagetter.sh) i exported them off of hawk.

## results
the CheckM analysis produced [this output directory](https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/tree/6be0be8a1de6b7fd64de79c280d9641f68a0e37c/02_middle-analysis_outputs/checkm_test_results). My export script exported all 10 "assembly_info.txt" files to a directory in my home directory, as well as adding their accession ID to the name, this is important as otherwise i wouldnt know which belonged to what accession. I then brought them down and stored them [here.](https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/tree/6be0be8a1de6b7fd64de79c280d9641f68a0e37c/05_projectdatabase/flyestuff)

## conclusions
with it being christmas i did not take a serious look at the significance of the outputs of either, so that is what i plan to do next so that i can have some conclusions, maybe by the end of tomorrow. In conclusion, this process is only half done and will continue into the following entry(s).
