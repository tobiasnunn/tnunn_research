### 2024-12-24 de novo prelim
3 days ago i was looking through the gtdbtk manual and saw that "de_novo_wf" was an option for analysis to create the trees, from the description given:
https://ecogenomics.github.io/GTDBTk/commands/de_novo_wf.html
i beleived this would be something i should do as it might produce more accurate trees. sample 1Dt2d "Enterobacter cancerogenus" had been placed by the "classify_wf" in the previous gtdbtk analysis in the genus "Pantoea", which lead me to this search. after a bit of trial and error, i produced this script: https://github.com/tobiasnunn/tnunn_research/blob/21f2fb071d76040dc82286b9399cb11ff11a3b3c/00_scripts/de_novo_gtdbtk.sh 
this ran as a slurm job on hawk (SCW) from rougly 20:10 on the 23rd to 01:00 on the 24th, totalling 4 hours and 50 minutes. the main parameters that i experimented with were

- #SBATCH --ntasks=5
- #SBATCH --time=24:00:00
- #SBATCH --mem=50g
- --cpus 10
