# Introduction to notebook

For the introduction and conclusion section for ENS2002 i need to prove that i have read the literature and understand the area of science i am opperating in and why this project is significant in the advancement of science. With a specific focus on "what is my research question". So this document is where i am going to put my notes when i read a scientific paper in or around "Host-Microbiome interactions with an emphesis on genetics". I will put the full list in a zotero folder, i wonder if i can somehow get them onto the github repot?

# Papers

## Plantâ€“microbiome interactions under a changing world: responses, consequences and perspectives

### How does this paper relate to me?

I chose this paper because it is modern, It was published on the 4th of February 2022 within the last 3 years as of today (2025-01-30) and covers the main area of interest, host-microbe interactions. I read the abstract and it seemed perfectly relevant to this study. In their summary, they mention the importance of the microbiome of plants to adapting to their environment and thus, their role in mitigating the effect of climate change, as well as mentioning analysis at the genomic level (Trivedi et al. 2022). Whilst plants are not amphibians I believe this is wholly relevant to my work. My aim is to learn more about genetic composition of amphibian skin microbiomes and thus how they might interact with their host, but also environmental factors such as chitrid fungus, which, much like climate change, is a very large threat to biodiversity at this time, and interacts consistently with the ever mysterious microbiomes.

### Summaries, notes, etc

Potential disaster climate change will have / have had on plants and agriculture. Microbiome all over plants, very linked. Past studies (Naylor & Coleman-Derr, 2018; Singh et al., 2020a; Trivedi et al., 2020, 2021) found that these links help protect from environmental changes. warming and drought. how microbiomes might change under stess.

There is then a section on plant-pathogen interactions, interesting. They mention abiotic stresses on the relationships. They then talk about beneficial host-microbe relationships

### Thoughts and discussion

They talk about how the host and the bacteria "coevolve" - try to think of this, the bacteria will have evolved to suit the frog, they must do something beneficial or at least neutral to it, so what happens if i find something potentially harmful?

The importance of variation among the bacteria, this is the point of the heatmaps. But, the heatmaps rule out ubiquitous map IDs, so what if there are genes that all the groups express near equally, ones that are a sort of "requirement" to have to be able to live on the frog skin? Those would be filtered out by the analysis

unrelated, kind of, but i just had the thought, has anyone sequenced the genome of Bd, the fungus causing chitrid? that might be useful, maybe knowing what it does and doesnt have can help figure out a way to kill it.

try and relate what the microbiome does both to defense and other benefits to host.

bit of a morbid thought, but could we sample frogs that have died from chitrid, if we know what bacteria have survived, maybe we know what bacteria are most likely to be probiotic if introduced.
